Introduction
t was Sunday. Some of my friends came to me. My mother was not at home. She had gone to market. I thought to prepare tea. I went into the kitchen. I lighted the stove. I put the kettle with water on it. When the water was boiling, I put tealeaves into it. After 3-4 minutes, I put some milk and some sugar into it. Now the tea was ready. I put (poured) it into the teapot. I took the teapot with cups and plates to the friends. I served tea to them. The tea was very tasty. I was very happy.t was Sunday. Some of my friends came to me.
