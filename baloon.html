Like airships, balloons are lighter-than-air craft. They are filled with a gas or heated air that makes them float in the air. Early experiments with balloon flight led to the development of the motor-powered airship and later the airplane.

Balloons come in all shapes and sizes, from small toy balloons to large passenger balloons. They can be used for advertising purposes, for scientific experiments, for entertainment, or for recreation. Giant balloons of cartoon characters and other entertaining subjects are familiar sights in parades. These are controlled by people on the ground, who carry them along the parade route. Scientific balloons and those used for recreation are free to move through the air as they are guided by a pilot.
